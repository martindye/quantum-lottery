Lottery lines created from hex web source

This was basically a test project to try out Visual Studio Code (a hostile environment when coming from Visual Studio) and Git.

Reads random hex numbers form specified source, discards numbes which are out of range or duplicated
and makes lottery numbers for the UK National lottery (number range: 1-59, items per line: 6)
